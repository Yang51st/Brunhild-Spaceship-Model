Designed in Fusion 360 by me, Yang Li, the model is meant to showcase my knowledge of and skill in solid and surface modelling. Included in this repository are .stl files of the finished model in its entirety, as well as .stl files of the model broken up into smaller components to allow for easier 3D printing.
